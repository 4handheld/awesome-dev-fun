# Contribution Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Suggested packages should make me laugh and be documented.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[package](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Link to the public repo if it exists, else link to anything relevant.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Check your spelling and grammar. Only exception to the rule are puns. Great puns, horrible puns. Butt only puns.
- The pull request should use the provided GitHub template.
